# NLP-1 Project

## Natural Language Processing approaches to predict sentiment and topic classification using different text processing methods.

The goal of this project is to develop and test two text classification systems:

Task 1: sentiment analysis, in particular to predict the sentiment of movie reviews, i.e. positive or negative (binary classification).
Task 2: topic classification, to predict whether a news article is about International issues, Sports or Business (multi-class classification).
